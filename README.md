# my-rock-paper-scissors-game

Applying Python and object-oriented programming skills, I built a Rock Paper Scissors game 
as part of my final projects in my Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree program,
with subclasses of computer players and a human player class that lets a user play the game against the computer.
